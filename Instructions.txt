Instructions

1) Download and unzip the script package.

2) Upload the script on your server.

3) Edit form.php file and set your email address, where message will be received, and email subject in the following lines:

define('_EMAIL_TO', 'admin@domain.com');
define('_EMAIL_FROM', 'no-reply@domain.com');
define('_EMAIL_SUBJECT', 'Contact Form');

4) Open the example web page index.html using any web browser.

To load the form on another web page, just add the following code before closing the <body> tag:

<script type="text/javascript" src="embed.js"></script>

If the Contact Form is loaded in a folder on your server, you need to specify the path for the js file. For example:

<script type="text/javascript" src="/FOLDER_NAME/embed.js"></script>

5) If the form is loaded in different file and from another folder on your server, you need to specify the path where the files are located. 

In order to make it work, open file "embed.js" and change line 135 to point to your sliding form folder. 

It is now like this: 
server_url = document.location.href.replace(/([a-z.]+)$/i, '');

change it to
server_url = 'http://YOUR DOMAIN/FOLDER_NAME/';
